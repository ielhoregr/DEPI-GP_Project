# DEPI-GP-Project

A comprehensive sentiment analysis project comparing traditional machine learning approaches with modern transformer-based models for analyzing Amazon product reviews. The project evaluates the performance of classical methods (Logistic Regression, SVM) against a fine-tuned BERT model.

## Project Overview
This project aims to:
- Compare the effectiveness of traditional ML models vs. transformer-based models in sentiment analysis
- Analyze Amazon review data for sentiment classification
- Demonstrate the advantages and trade-offs between different approaches
- Implement and fine-tune a BERT model for improved sentiment analysis

## Project Structure

### Week 1: Data Exploration & Preprocessing
Initial data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing of Amazon reviews dataset. This phase includes text normalization, handling missing values, and preparing data for both classical and deep learning approaches.

### Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
Comprehensive analysis of the dataset characteristics, including sentiment distribution, review length analysis, and feature extraction for classical models. The EDA phase helps inform model selection and feature engineering decisions.

### Week 3-4: Model Implementation & Comparison
Implementation of two approaches:
1. Classical Machine Learning Pipeline:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Feature engineering and vectorization

2. BERT Implementation:
   - Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment classification
   - Model optimization and evaluation
   - Comparative analysis with classical methods

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn (for classical ML models)
- Transformers library (for BERT)
- PyTorch
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn

## Usage
1. Start with the exploration notebook to understand the data
2. Review the EDA findings to understand feature importance
3. Run both classical and BERT models for comparison
4. Use the inference notebooks for predictions
